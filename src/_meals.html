        Remember, Mama Barraco doesn’t only make great Italian entrees, she also
        makes mouthwatering appetizers and heart stopping desserts. If you’re
        just looking for a light meal, she has combined Italian and American
        traditions to create our Caesar and Chipotle wraps on Honey Wheat. The
        Barraco Family hasn’t forgotten about the gluten intolerants either. She
        has whipped up some tasty gluten free pastas and pizza.

        Mama Barraco and the rest of the Barraco Family continue to treat every patron like
        family. So, get a pizza and a glass of wine, kick your feet up and
        relax, because life is meant to be enjoyed and here at Barraco’s we know
        how to enjoy life.
